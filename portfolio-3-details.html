             <!--<h4>Introduction</h4>-->
              <p>
                 With an estimated twelve million visitors each year,
                 Barcelona is one of the best-known and most visited 
                 cities in Europe. This city  is famous for its outstanding football team, 
                 stunning architecture, lively nightlife, sandy beaches, and world-class cuisine.
                  Not to mention a vibrant cultural heritage and colorful neighborhood festivals 
                  that attract visitors and settlers from around the world. Barcelona regularly 
                  features in the annual lists of the world’s smartest cities and most foreign
                  resident originally moved there with the intention of staying for a couple
                  of years but ended up enjoying the lifestyle so much that they ended up staying.
                  Hence, for this project, I felt it would be interesting to gain an insight about
                  the pricing of residential house in this marvelous City. 
                </p>
                       <p>
                              <b><i>"How much should this house cost? ". </i></b>
                      </p>
                       <p>
                             	<b><i>"How can we better estimate prices?". </i></b>
                    </p>    

           <p>
                 This  question were especially interesting to me in the context 
                  of this real estate data analysis project,  the first step is to gather
                  the data needed to answer it and develop a modeling plan. 
                  I got my data from scrapping  housing detail  from 
                  <a href=" https://www.thinkspain.com/"  >www.thinkspain.com</a> and carried out various data  and model 
                  Analysis to provide answers to the questions above. 
                 I also needed to carry out price prediction Analysis from various 
                 house advertising description details, hence, used the opportunity
                 to learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP)
                <p>
                         The articles in this series dive deep into each step in this project,
                          including data preparation, modeling, and iteration  based on 
                          evaluations of the models in order to find the best possible model for
                          predicting Barcelona province real estate prices
                </p>
            </p>
 
    
            <h3>Project Strategy</h3>
            <p>
                  This project had several facets outlined in the flow diagram below. 
            </p>
             <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/Barcelona-flow-chat.jpg" alt=""> 
              <br>
              <br>
                     <p>The Python libraries used include Pandas (for data cleanig and manipulation),
                            BeautifulSoup and request (for Web Scrapping), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit for text analysis),
                            GEOPY (for locations geocoding analysis), MatPlotlibe(for data visualization), 
                            Word Cloud ( for text visualization), sklearn (for model analysis), 
                            and other built-in libraries. 
                       </p>
           
             <h4> Web Scrapping</h4>
             <p> This was probably the most arduous part of the project because, 
                     unlike my previous projects, where I had existing datasets, 
                     I had to build this one from scratch. To do that, I used the Beautiful library
                    for Python to scrape data from www.thinkspain.com.
           </p>
         <p> Web scraping can be tiresome. That is because web scraping truly depends on how clean the html code underlying the website is.  The Real Estate observations which are scraped for this project are divided into different areas in Spain. That means in order to find and group every property for each area, it is first necessary to find all the URLs associated with that individual area.
                 The strategy of the scraping then starts with first finding all the links to each province and click on the Barcelona province, then  secondly is to find all the url of various locations within the Barcelona province and   scrape all the relevant property information for each location. 
         </p>
            <p>The data for this project was scrapped on the 11th of August, I concentrated on data from houses that has details on Bedroom, Bathroom, Building size and plot of land  and skip data on house that doesn't have details for this 4 variables for uniformity sake. All of this data was extracted from the very first web page of various locations within Barcelona province</p> 
               <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/Barcelona-web.jpg" alt=""> 
            <br>
            <br>
           
          <h4>Data Cleaning</h4>
          <p>
                Cleaning up your data is very vital because it helps to prevent errors in your analysis.  In this section, I remove the “m2” and “€” from the Building size, Plot of land and Price column  and furthermore, I converted the columns from an object columns to an int columns. 
          </p> 
                    
            <h4>Data Exploration</h4>
          <p>
                Under this section, I carried out different data analytic task which includes :
          </p> 
            <ul>
                  <li>Location geocoding</li>
                  <li>Outliers detection and remover</li>
                 <li>Natural language processing analysis</li>
                <li>Word cloud</li>
            </ul>
           
           <p><b>
                  Location geocoding</b>
           </p>    
             <p>  For my final dashboard, I wanted to add a map that shows Cluster grouping of different houses with same similarities within Barcelona province. Tableau needs basic geographic information to archive this. To further retrieve my longitude and Latitude data from each location within the province , I made use of GEOPY, a library in python that takes a country/city  name as input and produce the corresponding longitude and Latitude as output</p>    
           
              <p><b>Outliers</b></p>
             <p>Outliers are data points in a dataset that are considered to be extreme, false, or not representative of what the data is describing. These outliers can be caused by either incorrect data collection or genuine outlying observations, the figure below shows a representation of outliers in Bedroom column</p>
          <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/barca-out.jpg" alt="">
          <p>It is clearly visible that the data are heavily skewed to the right. This  means that most of the data is centered at the left side of the distribution, with fewer observations on the right side. This occurs because of : </p>
          <p> Despite the fact that the website is supposed to show only valid houses and estates, there are still some properties which are not valid and skew the distribution drastically to the right, like large commercial properties such as hotels and restaurant spaces. We can see from the graph above that there are apparently several observations with more than 10 Bedroom. These are definitely not features one would expect to see in an ordinary   residential house .</p>
          <p> To get rid of the outliers, I made use of the Interquartile Range Method for my Outliers remover. The interquartile range approach first calculates the interquartile range (IQR) of the data. The IQR is defined as the difference between the 75 and 25 percentile of a variable. This IQR is then multiplied with 1.5. Any data that is then further away than the 75 percentile plus 1.5IQR or 25 percentile minus 1.5IQR is classified as an outlier.</p>
          <p> After carrying out the above analysis, it was found that according to our data , any house with Bedroom less than 1 or greater than 9 should be considered an outlier and hence should be drop. </p>  
           
             <p><b> Natural language processing analysis</b></p>  
           <p>
               Natural language processing (NLP) is a field that focuses on making natural human language usable by computer programs. In this section, I Analyze and made exploring Analysis on each house advertisement descriptions using NLP pre-processing and visualization techniques.
             </p>
            <p>
                Each real estate listing scraped contains a text component, the ad description. The descriptions are actually previews of the full descriptions, scraped from the listing page. The description text helps to explain what the numbers alone cannot. For example, two house with similar details such as same numbers of bathroom, bedroom etc may have different price tag, hence Price differences of such a houses with identical feature values make it very difficult for the model to learn. Looking at the description of each house explains the price difference: the house with the highest price  may be  located directly on a beach or have great mountain view. This is an important information that will help our model learn to better predict these prices.
           </p>  
            <p>
                 After scraping the description preview for all real estate listings, I was left with text samples that looked like this:
            </p>
            <i>
                <ol>

            </i>
            <p>My goal was to use the information from this text Analysist to help my model predict real estate prices.</p>
           <p>The steps taken for analyzing the text data are as follows:</p>  
            <ol>
                     <li>
                       Tokenize the data </li>
                     <li>
                       Lemmatize the data
                    </li>
                   <li>
                        Get n-grams </li>
                     <li>
                        Visualize
                    </li>
                   <li>
                        Repeat
                    </li>
               </ol>
              <p> <b> Tokenization</b></p>
           <p>
                Tokenization involves splitting text into its smallest components, called tokens. Tokens are the building blocks of a sentence that, when combined, give text its meaning.
                In this step, I split each house description into individual word text, I  also removed any tokens representing punctuation or known English stop words.
          </p>  
       
          <p> <b> Lemmatization</b></p>
           <p>
                Once I  had the text split into its component tokens, the next step was to make sure these tokens contain as much information as possible for the model to learn from. There is common way to do this: lemmatization. This is  used to reduce words to their root
           </p>  
    
            <p> <b> create n-gram</b></p>
           <p>
                After tokenizing and lemmatizing the words, I extract n-grams. N-grams are token groups of n words that commonly appear together in a document. A unigram is just one single word, a bigram contains 2-word groupings, and so on. N-grams help us to quickly identify the most important words and terms in our descriptions.
            </p>  
       
          <p> <b> Visualization</b></p>
           <p>
                Next, I  visualized which words were the most important and asked the question: “are these words going to help my  model learn to estimate price? How can they better support the model’s understanding?. Below are the initial n-gram plots, plotted with words from the entire corpus of advertisement description
           </p>
             <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/uni.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
           <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/bi.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/tri.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
           <p>
                The most common uni-, bi- and tri-grams are “room", “dining” “living" , "bathroom”. These are all typical real estate-focused words, and many of them are likely not going to help us in our model’s prediction of price.
            </p> 
           
          <p><b>Repeat</b></p>
           <p>
                 After looking at my initial visualisations, i decided to add the following steps in my text pre-processing pipeline:
                Remove additional real Estate words and repeat the process
           </p>
         <p>
              real_estate_stopwords = [ "area","province", "location",
"plot",  "hectare",
"m²", "m2",
 "sq",
"sale",
"square",
"meter", "bedroom", "bathroom",
  "room",
"living",  "kitchen",
  "hallway",
 "corridor",
"dining",
   "pool",   "apartment",
 "flat",
  "floor",
  "two",
 "house"
 ]
        </p>
           <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/uni2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
           <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/Bi2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            <img style= " width: 100%;  height:50%;"  src="assets/img/portfolio/Tri2.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
           <p>
                After adding these steps to our pre-processing pipeline, the n-grams became much more interesting: The bigrams and trigrams are no longer dominated by words like bedroom and bathroom. They now contain price-relevant terms like “sea view”, “mountain", and "garden” .
            </p> 
          
          <p> <b> Word cloud </b></p>
           <p>
                A word cloud is a collection, or cluster, of words depicted in different sizes. The bigger and bolder the word appears, the more often it’s mentioned within a given text and the more important it is.
                In this section, I did a world cloud view on the entire description text column , also did another on the 10 least expensive houses and another on the 10 most expensive houses
           </p>

                we can clearly see a stark difference in the most common words. In the expensive houses, we have words like view, sea, space, office, all of this words are the characteristics of an expensive house and this are not found in the least expensive house above.

                          In order to carry out the price model analysis based on the numerical details provided in the data , I first of all did a heat map chart to find the correlation between all the numerical variables and from the chart , it was evident that Building size with a correlation Price fit of 0.73 is the best single data fit according to the dataset to predict house Price.

                      	 I used K-means cluster machine algorithm to group the different houses into a cluster of 3. From the data ,177 house have same similarities and falls under cluster 0, 73 falls under cluster 1 and 5 in cluster 3
                     </li>
                     <li>
                          	I compare between Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear regression, which  was best for price prediction according to the available data. Using mean square error and r square error, it was shown that Multiple Linear regression was best for our price prediction. From the Multiple Linear regression Analysis, I arrive at the equation for price prediction

              <p><b> Price prediction base on NLP text </b></p>
              <p>For the NLP Machine Model, I used Bags-of-words and TF-IDF to carry out my NLP Machine model </p>
              <ul>
                     <li>
                          <p><b>  bag-of-words </b></p>
                          <p>  bag-of-words procedure falls under a broader category of techniques known as count-based representations. These are techniques to analyze documents by indicating how frequently certain types of structures occur throughout.
                                  I created a word-document co-occurrence matrix for the Description_new_text column using the "CountVectorizer"  class that automatically accounts for certain preprocessing steps like removing stopwords, stemming, creating n-grams, and word tokenization and furthermore used LogisticRegresssion technique to train and test the model.
                                  From the model, I did an interpretable features form  in  terms of words that  contributed the most to expensive and not so expensive sentiment:

                      </li>
                     <li>
                         <p><b>TF-IDF</b></p>
                         <p>Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) evaluates how important a word is to a document within a large collection of documents (i.e. corpus). The importance increases proportionally based on the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus. I created a word-document co-occurrence matrix for the Description_new_text column using the “ TfidfVectorizer”  class that automatically accounts for certain preprocessing steps like removing stopwords, stemming, creating n-grams, and word tokenization and furthermore used LogisticRegresssion technique to train and test the model.</p></li>

               <h4>Tableau Dashboard</h4>

                       I made use of Tableau to create a user-friendly interactive dashboard, where houses with similar characteristics are group into clusters. This allows you to explore the house details, filtered by  locations. Please note that while the dashboard can be viewed on any device, it is preferable to view it with a Tablet or a Computer.
              </p>
              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>We started this data science project with a seemingly simple question — “What is the price of this property? How can we improve our price estimations?”</p>
              <p> The past articles in this series have shown the work needed to answer this question. After gathering data from the  real estate web using web scraping, a significant amount of time was spent cleaning the data and extracting the features needed for modeling.
                      We tested multiple  modeling method which  including Random Forests, Multiple Linear Regression, Bags-of-words and TF-IDF  modeling technique.
                      Multiple Linear Regression standout to be the best for price prediction based on Predictor variable such as numbers of Bedrooms, Bathroom, size of Buildings and size of Land while Bags-of-words standout to be the best for price prediction based on description text prediction variable.
               </p>
             <p>
                     With our final models, and the data understanding we’ve gained throughout this project process, we can now answer our original question of which factors are most influential in predicting the price of Barcelona real estate, and how we can improve our estimation.
                    The features building size and bathroom were highly correlated with Price of various houses,  including the house descriptions  gave us great  insight into the condition of the property and this  further  greatly improved the model.
            </p>
